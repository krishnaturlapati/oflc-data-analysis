# OFLC Data Analysis
Analysis of H1-B disclosure data from the Office of Foreign Labor Certification. This dataset is interesting because it contains repeated observations of the same variables over 11 years.

## Problem Definition

The objective is use the publicly available H1-B disclosure data to build a model that can predict the visa approval status of a H1-B application. The secondary objective is to interpret the results to find which factors influence the approval status. 

## Data Extraction 

The OFLC performance disclosure data can be obtained from this link https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm. Save the 13 xlsx in a raw or a staging area, couple of columns contain embedded commas its recommened that save the xlsx to csv utf-8 format. Save the converted utf-8 csv's in a seperate folder. 

## Data Ingestion

The thirteen source files are in well defined csv's with headers, the most straight forward way is create a staging table in a RDBMS, I choose Postgres as my data sink. The source ddl's can be found here metadata_munging/ddl. Ingesting data in Postgres is very straight forward, we can leverage `COPY .. FROM ..` construct.   

## Data Wrangling/Cleaning   

Data cleaning is the most crucial part of any data science project. This data set is no different and is messy. Couple of challenges with this data set 

* Normalize field names across all thirteen years 
* Impute missing data
* The key observation prevailing wage or salary can be measured in hourly, weekly, biweekly, monthly or yearly format. 
* Derive additional fields as necessary 
* Create one core table for all data 

**Metadata Munging** 

Original Metadata, viewing the metadata of all 13 files in one layout helps in understanding the schema evolution. Not all fields are consistent and we have new and interesting fields not available for history.  This new fields unfortunately be backfilled.

In short the response variable for the model will be the field which has the following aliases  APPROVAL_STATUS, STATUS or CASE_STATUS and the other fields describe the applicants profile

After normalizing all columns, the following columns seem to have consistent history across time and are more relevant to the problem definition. This is the final schema used for modeling
